This repository stores projects that I wrote in Python as studying. <br>
 <br>
The most interesting projects are tg_bots_asyncio_aiogram/trafo_bot_app <br>
This is async bot was written to facilitate work in a group of mechanics. <br>
The concept was that with the help of a telegram it was possible to perform (for example) various calibrations of equipment using a database <br>
for storing workstations and its equipment, and when pressing buttons in the menu,  <br> select an action, for example calibrating templates, after which the bot sends a drawing or several, as well as where the workplace is located. <br>
After taking the dimensions on the template, send a response to the bot, and it writes them into the database, then updates the Excel file, and, after finishing calibrating the templates, sends the result to the mechanics manager. <br>
But they did not want to put this project into operation, and its development was stopped. <br>
<br>
Second project is Rice2D, it was supposed to be an online browser game, but, while expanding various features in this game, <br>
and with an increase in the number of connected players to the server, the game began to sharply lose FPS (frame per second). <br>
But, with the help of this project, I fully understood the concept of a client-server application (Also TCP/UDP), the way data is transferred, the volume of this data and the ability to protect it.
Also, after this project, I began to study Javascript, and came to the realization of why so many programming languages ​​were created and for what area of ​​work they were created.
